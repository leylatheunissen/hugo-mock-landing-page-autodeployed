# hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed

This repository is a landing page for a hypothetical web app, SkillScript, that helps job seekers personalize their resumes and cover letters. While it does not have any features built out yet, it serves to demonstrate the potential interface of the site and to experiment with the Hugo bootstrap theme.

It also includes a new contact page, for which a workflow was created, that allows users to report an issue on Github.
